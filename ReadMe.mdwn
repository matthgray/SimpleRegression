# A Simple Regression

What is the relationship between salary and years of experience? This Data and code are pulled from https://www.superdatascience.com/pages/machine-learning. This is apart of the Machine Learning A-Z course on Udemy. I did make some charts in Google Data Studio. It consists of key stats from the data such as: Average, Standard Deviation, Maximum, Minimum.
